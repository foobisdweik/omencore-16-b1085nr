# OmenCore Roadmap — v2.4.0

**Target**: v2.4.0 (Next feature release)

---

## Goal
Ship a stable, safety-first release that completes deferred UX improvements from v2.3.2 and addresses reliability, testing, packaging, and CI hardening.

---

## ✅ Deferred from v2.3.2 (carryover)
- OSD horizontal layout full XAML implementation
- OSD preset layouts (Minimal, Standard, Full, Custom)
- More robust storage exclusion and handling for drive sleep

---

## 🔴 Critical (blocker-level)
- Desktop safety & monitoring improvements (acceptance: desktop detection + no fan writes by default; tests) ✅
- Fan control reliability & diagnostics (HpWmiBios improvements + additional telemetry when fallbacks occur) — acceptance: reproduce known failing models and verify graceful fallback
- CI: Add `TreatWarningsAsErrors` build variant to catch nullable-reference regressions before merge

---

## 🔵 High priority
- Accurate FPS counter (D3D11 hook) — acceptance: in-game FPS equals observed frames in test harness
- OSD layout editor & preset system (save / load / apply) — acceptance: users can create, select, and persist OSD presets
- Per-game OSD profiles (apply by process name / game rom id)
- Properly initialize large ViewModels (fix nullable warnings by constructor injection) — acceptance: `dotnet build -p:TreatWarningsAsErrors=true` passes on CI

---

## 🟢 Medium priority
- Unit & integration tests for: HpWmiBios, OSD refresh on mode change, Linux GitHub button fallback, Avalonia DynamicResource loading
- Coverage target: +15% lines by v2.4.0
- Linux packaging: build and publish linux-arm64 artifact and verify on supported distros
- Improve diagnostics export format (structured JSON with dmesg, hp-wmi outputs) for bug reports

---

## ⚪ Low priority / Nice-to-have
- GUI micro-optimizations (reduce memory for low-overhead mode)
- Accessibility improvements for UI automation and keyboard navigation
- More release automation: auto-publish checksums and artifacts on release tag

---

## Collaboration & Kernel support
- Document steps to reproduce and a minimal patch to add the OMEN MAX 16z board ID to `hp-wmi` — include `dmesg` output examples and how to test
- Reach out to maintainers via patchwork and provide test hardware info (volunteers)

---

## Acceptance Criteria & Definition of Done
- All Critical tasks have tests (unit/integration) and pass CI with `TreatWarningsAsErrors` enabled
- Release artifacts published and SHA256 checksums included in changelog
- User-visible changes documented in `CHANGELOG_v2.4.0.md` and `README.md` where applicable

---

## Owners & Estimates (suggested)
- Core & CI: @theantipopau — 2w
- OSD & D3D11 Hook: @someone-graphics — 3w
- Linux & packaging: @linux-tester — 1w
- Testing & QA: @qa-team — 2w

---

## Next steps
1. Create triage issues for the 
   - CI change, 
   - Quick nullable fix PR, 
   - D3D11 hook spike, 
   - OSD editor spike, 
   - Linux ARM64 build
2. Add milestone `v2.4.0` and move the created issues into it
3. Track progress with project board columns: Backlog → In Progress → Review → Done
